# NetDevOps-Setup-Notes

Collection of notes dedicated to my setup and journey into NetDevOps.

- These notes document my experience and may not accommodate your situation in some aspects.
  - My platform was a Mac and most notes will reflect that. Moreover, it is highly recommended to use a Mac or another Unix/Linux-based platform over Windows.
- There may be some inaccuracies in the documented concepts, as they simply reflect my interpretation along the way. Please let me know if there are any discrepancies and I would be happy to clear things up!

## Order of Operations

Notes have been categorized into key topics and sequenced in recommended order of operations:

1. [Preparing the Environment](pages/env-prep.md)
2. [Visual Studio Code](pages/vscode.md)
3. [Getting Started with Git](pages/git.md)
4. [Ansible](pages/ansible.md)
5. [Streamlit](pages/streamlit.md)
