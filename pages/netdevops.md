# NetDevOps-Setup-Notes

Collection of notes dedicated to my setup and journey into NetDevOps.

- These notes document my experience and may not accommodate your situation in some aspects.
  - My platform was a Mac and most notes will reflect that. Moreover, it is highly recommended to use a Mac or another Unix/Linux-based platform over Windows.
- There may be some inaccuracies in the documented concepts, as they simply reflect my interpretation along the way. Please let me know if there are any discrepancies and I would be happy to clear things up!
